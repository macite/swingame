- Some of the include paths in the build settings are absolute, yet I can still build fine with them
	They are probably not all needed.
- Header search paths for the static lib and the test program are different.
	There are no SDL file in the test program.
- Each VBO can only be associated with one OpenGL context (not sure of the best way around this, probably have to allow the user to change the current rendering context)
- Same for VAOs

- Added the wfc library, and included it in library search path for both targets
